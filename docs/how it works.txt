## Project Reiko: Comprehensive Explanation

This document provides a detailed explanation of how Project Reiko works. It covers the purpose of each component, the flow of execution, and a flowchart to visualize the process.

---

### 1. Project Overview

Project Reiko is a personal assistant designed to:
- Track user emotions.
- Provide appropriate responses based on detected emotions.
- Learn from user interactions over time to improve its accuracy.

It uses **keyword matching**, **intensifiers**, and **negations** to analyze sentiment and provides responses based on predefined data. The system also tracks mood history to analyze trends over time.

---

### 2. Core Components

The system consists of the following core components:

#### **1. `main.cpp`**
- **Purpose**: Entry point of the program.
- **Responsibilities**:
  1. Initializes the program by calling `preload()` to load data.
  2. Accepts user input and appends a special end-of-input marker (`__EnD_Of_InPuT_123!@#__`).
  3. Calls `fixTypo()` to process the input and correct typos.
  4. Calls `keyWord_match()` to analyze the input and generate responses.

---

#### **2. `preload.cpp`**
- **Purpose**: Loads data from files into memory.
- **Responsibilities**:
  1. Initializes global variables such as:
     - `valid_words`, `hi_words`, `emotion_words`, `intensifier_words`.
     - Various sets of sentences and replies for different emotions.
  2. Loads data from text files using the `fileManager` functions.
  3. Prepares the system for emotion tracking and response generation.

---

#### **3. `sentenceProcessing.cpp`**
- **Purpose**: Normalizes and tokenizes user input.
- **Responsibilities**:
  1. **`normalizer()`**:
     - Converts input to lowercase while preserving the end-of-input marker.
  2. **`tokenizer()`**:
     - Splits sentences into individual words and punctuation marks.
     - Removes greetings (e.g., "hello", "hi") from the input.

---

#### **4. `test_typo.cpp`**
- **Purpose**: Fixes typos in user input.
- **Responsibilities**:
  1. **`edit_distance()`**:
     - Calculates the edit distance between two strings using dynamic programming.
  2. **`get_best_match()`**:
     - Finds the best matching word from a set of valid words based on edit distance.
  3. **`fixTypo()`**:
     - Corrects typos in the tokenized input by comparing tokens with a list of valid words.

---

#### **5. `emotionTracker.cpp`**
- **Purpose**: Tracks emotions in user input.
- **Responsibilities**:
  1. **`keyWord_match()`**:
     - Matches tokens with emotion words and calculates an emotion score for each sentence.
     - Handles intensifiers (e.g., "very") and negations (e.g., "not").
  2. **`updateEmotionScore()`**:
     - Updates the emotion score for the current sentence based on detected emotions.
  3. **`thisIstheEnd()`**:
     - Finalizes the last sentence when the end-of-input marker is encountered.

---

#### **6. `fileManager.cpp`**
- **Purpose**: Manages file operations.
- **Responsibilities**:
  1. **`fileManager()`**:
     - Reads data from files into `unordered_set` structures.
  2. **`FileManager()`**:
     - Reads data from files into `unordered_map` structures.
  3. **`FileManager2()`**:
     - Reads data from files into `unordered_map<string, vector<pair<int, double>>>` structures.

---

#### **7. `responseManager.cpp`**
- **Purpose**: Generates responses based on the detected emotions.
- **Responsibilities**:
  1. **`getEmotionResponse()`**:
     - Returns a basic response for a given emotion type and intensity.
  2. **`generateResponse()`**:
     - Generates a complete response based on the emotions detected in a sentence.
  3. **`respondHI()`**:
     - Generates a greeting response.
  4. **`responseGenerate()`**:
     - Orchestrates the response generation process and provides a summary of the user's mood.

---

### 3. Data Structures and Global Variables

The system uses several global variables to store data and configuration information. These variables are declared as `extern` in `library.h` and defined in `preload.cpp` or `emotionTracker.cpp`.

#### **Key Variables**
1. **`valid_words`**:
   - A set of valid words used for typo correction.
2. **`hi_words`**:
   - A set of greeting words (e.g., "hello", "hi").
3. **`emotion_words`**:
   - A map of emotion words and their corresponding emotion types and values.
4. **`intensifier_words`**:
   - A map of intensifier words and their corresponding values.
5. **`emotionScore`**:
   - The current emotion score for a sentence.
6. **`emotionPer_sentence`**:
   - Stores the emotion score, emotion type, and intensity for each sentence.
7. **`intensifiervalu_andItsIndex`**:
   - Stores the intensifier value and its index.
8. **`trackedEmotionWords`**:
   - Tracks unknown emotion words for learning.
9. **`trackedIntensifierWords`**:
   - Tracks unknown intensifier words for learning.

### 4. Flow of Execution

The program execution flow is as follows:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `main()` function is executed.
   - `preload()` is called to load data from files into memory.

2. **User Input**:
   - User input is collected and appended with the end-of-input marker (`__EnD_Of_InPuT_123!@#__`).

3. **Processing Input**:
   - `fixTypo()` is called to correct typos in the input.
   - `tokenizer()` splits the input into tokens.
   - `keyWord_match()` analyzes the tokens to calculate emotion scores.

4. **Response Generation**:
   - `responseGenerate()` generates a response based on the detected emotions.
   - The user's mood history is updated.

5. **Learning**:
   - Unknown words are tracked in `trackedEmotionWords` and `trackedIntensifierWords`.
   - Context (current, previous, and next sentences) is recorded for each unknown word.
   - The program periodically analyzes the tracked data and asks the user for confirmation.

---

### 5. Learning and Adaptation

#### **Emotion Words**
- Tracked in `trackedEmotionWords` with:
  - Frequency of occurrence.
  - Context (current, previous, and next sentence emotion types and intensities).

#### **Intensifiers**
- Tracked in `trackedIntensifierWords` with:
  - Frequency of occurrence.
  - Context (current, previous, and next sentence intensifier values).

#### **User Confirmation**
- When a word's frequency reaches a threshold, the program asks:
  ```plaintext
  The word 'ecstatic' seems to be an emotion word (Type: Happy, Value: 4.0). Do you want me to remember this? (Yes/No)
  ```
